# Problem Statement

Fake news, or spreading of false information, has now become a major problem.The internet has become a popular and fast way of spreading news. However, it has also enabled the spread of biased and false information, to be even faster. Internet and social media bots are designed to create fake accounts and generate fake news and it is becoming difficult to track fake sources. 

# About This Solution

This website uses machine learning to predict whether a news is real or fake. It also has a review feature where users can review various news articles and news sources from a scale of 1-10 (this feature will only be available for signed-in users - v2.0 onwards). These reviews are aggregated and shown on the website. It maintains lists of fake news and fake sources and displays them on the home page. 

**Note: The accuracy of this model depends upon the data.**
